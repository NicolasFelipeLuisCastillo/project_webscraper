## Summary
This project implements a **web scraping** system in Python, designed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**.
The system aims to **extract information from Wiki-type sites** and **extract and organize real estate listings from a real estate portal** (e.g., Metrocuadrado, Ciencuadras, Properati, etc.), filtering the results by city or town.

All information is displayed on the console, but the architecture is prepared to be compatible with a future graphical user interface (GUI).
